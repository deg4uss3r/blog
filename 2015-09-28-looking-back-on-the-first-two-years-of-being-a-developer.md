# looking back on the first two years of being a developer

Becoming a developer is hard. I started coding about 2 years ago. Now I'm in
the top 50 contributors on npm, am a regular speaker at meetups, would do
pretty well at npm module trivia, and feel comfortable doing and am doing
pretty well for myself as a JavaScript consultant. This is a little writeup of
how I got into programming.

## Psychology
Four years ago I started as a freshman in Amsterdam to study Psychology.
Though at times it was interesting, it didn't do much for me. What I actually
wanted to do was Industrial Design to figure out how to make humans and
computers work well together. Unfortunately that required me to have elected
certain science courses at age 15, which I never did.

## HTML & CSS
Psychology bored me, so I put in the minimum amount of effort to prevent
getting kicked out of uni and focused on other things instead. I managed to get
a job as an Office Manager at a design agency for a day a week. There I saw the
most wonderful things being created, and I decided I wanted to make pretty
things too. So I dove into HTML & CSS, and started creating gray boxes in other
gray boxes. I even managed to embed some images. I was ready to become a
startup founder.

## JavaScript, act 1 (the framework monster)
School numbed my mind, so I wanted to create a company to make education more
entertaining. As a broke student with moderate connections and little
experience in the art of hustling there was but one option: build it myself.

I figured that if a 20-something in a movie could do it, so could I. I booted
up Google, searched how to create a "web app" and dove deep into the combined
mess of Codecademy, Angular documentation and Sails.js.

Looking back this was probably the least productive phase of my career. In the
end of this I had no idea how to write logic, had no conception of which
components made up applications and couldn't write a for-loop if my life
depended on it. I was trying to take shortcuts, the results were poor.

## C
After a few weeks of frustration of copy-and-pasting Angular and Sails
boilerplate I realized I wasn't getting anywhere. I talked to some people, and
ended up applying for the "Programming Minor" at the University of Amsterdam.

The minor started on 2013-09-01 with an accellerated version of Harvard's open
CS50 course. In a period of about 2 months, we dove head-first into data
structures, control flow, build systems, unix, recursion, web protocols, PHP,
C, shell and more. It was brutal. About 3 weeks in I almost quit (the exercises
were too hard, I was in tears), but somehow managed to pull through. After 2
months, 20% of the students had dropped out. I was now able to comfortably
write C.

## JavaScript, act 2 (the tale of NPM and React)
After Harvard's CS50 two more courses followed: algorithms and app-building.
Though algorithms was sharp and educational, the app-building course seemed
interesting, but empty and shallow. I didn't feel engaged by Ruby and Java.
Instead I decided it was time for me to pick up JavaScript again.

Instead of continuing the educational startup (I was still working on it in the
background) I decided to write my first npm package: a `yo` generator. It took
me about 2 weeks to build, but I felt amazing.

I continued building generators, modules to help build those generators and
started dipped my toes into React for a school assignment. React was a
game-changer for me. I was suddenly able to create interfaces without having to
understand those verbose DOM methods. State was less of a concern, and
applications felt cohesive. I was in love.

## Getting a job, act 1
At this point I had written half a dozen npm modules, done about 3 months of
React development and was gradually getting comfortable with JavaScript.
University minors are supposed to last 6 months, and I felt continuing
psychology was a dead end for me. Above all, I wanted to do more React!

So in a somehow odd turn of events, I reached out to
[@vjeux](https://twitter.com/vjeux), one of the React core developers, and he
landed me an interview for an internship position at Facebook!

The Facebook interviews were quite interesting. I ended up passing the first
and second round (general interview & project assignment) but messed up the
third round (live coding with an engineer). The whole process took about a full
month of my life, and was definitely worth it. I felt defeated, but
invigorated. After all: I had impressed Facebook engineers enough with my
handy work that they wanted to see me in action.

## Getting a job, act 2
I wasn't ready to go back to Psychology, so I applied at a Dutch magazine
startup where one of my friends worked. He got me an interview, and after two
somewhat rough interview rounds I was hired. This was all I dreamt of, right?

Wrong. I was fired after three weeks. The reason: I didn't fit in with the
team. My results were lacking, which in itself wasn't a problem, but I annoyed
other engineers. Looking back it wasn't surprising. Up until this point I had
only worked alone, and didn't know how to suggest improvements without coming
off as being harsh. Though on the other hand: my suggestions were warranted as
I haven't encountered a worse code base to date. It was probably for the
better that we split up.

## The Art of Unix programming
Probably the most important advice I got from one of the engineers of my
now-ex-employer was to read "The Art of Unix Programming". Though being
extremely dry, it also opened my eyes to what Unix is, and what it can do.

## Getting a job, act 3

## Shell

## Vim & tmux

## Writing things down

## GLSL
