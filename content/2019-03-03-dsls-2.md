In the last post we examined some examples of DSLs in Rust, and established that
using DSLs is a common practice.

In this post we'll look at some of the challenges around DSLs in Rust, and draw
on examples of how these have been solved in the past.

## Compile-time Optimization
The first thing to account for with DSLs is performance. If the DSL requires
compilation during runtime[^1], then it means you'll need to ship a DSL compiler
in your final binary. This not only increases code size, it can severely impact
performance.

That's why it's common to want to do all the parsing ahead of time.

## Consistent Interpolation

## Editor Integration
- run tooling on inline code
- syntax highlighting

## Macro Parsing Problems

## Conditional Compilation

## Conclusion

[^1]: "compilation during runtime" is a bit of a tongue twister. What I mean by
  that is a catch-all term for interpreting and compiling during runtime.
