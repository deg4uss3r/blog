Hi everyone. Thanks for arriving on my blog! This is a post about Rust 2019,
covering the last year, and looking forward to the next 3. I hope it comes in
useful!

## Looking back

Unlike some folks I'm no Rust veteran. I started casually tinkering with Rust
back in 2016, but only became serious about it in 2018.

2018 was the first time I had a chance to use [Rust
professionally](https://github.com/datrs), joined [a working
group](https://github.com/rust-clique), and then joined [another working
group](https://github.com/rust-net-web). And I guess I'm becoming involved with
[another working group](https://github.com/rustwasm/) now too. Whoops.

It's hard to reflect on 2018 by itself. I can't comment on how different 2018
was as opposed to, say, 2017. But I feel like things have continuously changed &
improved, and am super excited about it!

### Nice things
It's hard to pick a favorite moment in 2018. I think the project has progressed
a lot, and it's been wonderful to see. I'm particularly impressed by how
designs, ideas, and reflections have been shared in the open
[[1]](http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2018/06/20/proposal-for-a-staged-rfc-process/)

[[5]](https://medium.com/@shnatsel/how-ive-found-vulnerability-in-a-popular-rust-crate-and-you-can-too-3db081a67fb).

### Less nice things
Earlier this year someone in the Rust community got doxxed. It required several
people to step in, but it got dark. Not good.

At the end of the year [the new website](https://rust-lang.org) was met with
mixed reactions. Some positive. Some negative. And some unprofessional. I was
involved for part of the project, and drawing the ire of a mob isn't fun. Though
luckily I was shielded from the worst of it. Yay holiday. But still boo
overall.

Also the Net WG had a bit of trouble getting off the ground this year. It
[even had a
reboot](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/wg-net/blob/master/meetings/2018-08-03.md),
in August. And although good work has been done, we haven't operated nearly as
smoothly or consistently as the Embedded or WASM WGs have.

## Looking ahead

### People
I could say a lot, but others have said it better. In particular I implore you
to read [Boats](https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/rust-2019/) and
[Gattozzi](https://mgattozzi.com/rust-in-2019-the-next-year-and-edition/). I
endorse everything they've said, and think the points they raise should be
prioritized above all else.

Rust has been among the fastest growing programming languages
([chart](https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2018/11/growth_share_matrix-3.png),
[article](https://whoisnnamdi.com/the-growth-share-matrix-of-software-development/)),
and it is crucial for us to think about how we're going to deal with the next 3
years of (exponential) growth. Because our existing systems are going to hit
limits eventually, and [it's best to be in control when they
do](https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/263429.html).

Also I often think about [this
quote](https://twitter.com/aurynn/status/1062848550197911553) by Aurynn:

> Diversity is an emergent effect of inclusive behaviour.

I think it's important for us to reflect on the way we communicate. When is the
last time you've publicly admitted you made a mistake? If someone disengaged
from a conversation, why did disengage? If there's people that used to be
around, why aren't they around anymore? Have we actively reached out to people,
or did we just expect them to join in?

It's not only crucial for us to reflect on the grand scheme of things, but also
on the way *we* communicate. Talk to others. Ask for feedback. Dare to be
vulnerable. Try to be a better person, #rust-2019.

### Language
In all frankness I don't know a lot about language design. I'm very empathetic
to people that have been involved with the language though. And a sound I'm
increasingly hearing is: ["No new
features"](https://words.steveklabnik.com/thoughts-on-rust-in-2019). It think it
makes a lot of sense to work through the current backlog of features before
accepting any more.

I don't think anybody truly grasps Rust will feel like once we have [const
generics](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2000), [generalized type
ascription](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2522) and [generic associated
types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1598) in the language. We can try
and anticipate it, but it's hard to tell until we've tried it.

[Language design is fractal](https://youtu.be/0sIgVnRAcn0). Every change unlocks
the opportunity for more changes. I think it's healthy for the project to slow
down on designing more features, allowing the rest of us to catch up.

### Platforms
The [Rust WASM toolchain](https://github.com/rustwasm/) is fantastic! [Fitzgen
is talking](http://fitzgeraldnick.com/2018/12/11/rust-2019-think-bigger.html)
about the possibility of merging the WASM toolchain into Cargo itself. I think
Rust is well underway to positioning itself as a first-class language on the
web, and I couldn't be more excited!

I'd love see WASM's approach adopted for more targets. Can we make first-class
toolchains for iOS, Android, and
[BPF](https://opensource.com/article/17/9/intro-ebpf)? Can we build more
[high-quality cross-platform
abstractions](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.1.0/gfx_hal/)? I'd love to see us try!

### Compiler
Similarly to language design, I don't know much about the compiler. I've
started implementing [a small
feature](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/55715), but I ran out of time
before I could finish. This was not so much because of people, but because of my
hardware. The feedback cycle between making a change to the compiler and seeing
the results is about 45 minutes for me (apparently this is "fast"). And it's not
just code, it's docs too.

I think it'd be amazing if the project could find a way to make compiler hacking
more accessible. I think the structure used in
[chalk](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/chalk) and
[datafrog](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/datafrog) are excellent examples
of what could be done to improve.

There's lots of cool things happening in compiler land, and I think it's a shame
if those are only be accessible to people who have the financial means to buy
fast computers (like me).

### Workflow
Node.js's [mkdirp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mkdirp) package has 5 million
weekly downloads. By contrast Rust's most popular package,
[libc](https://crates.io/crates/libc), has 11 million downloads total. People
using Node.js apparently want to regularly create directories recursively.

This was reason enough for Node.js to add a `recursive` flag to
[`fs.mkdir()`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_mkdir_path_options_callback)
earlier this year. I'm glad they did. But I think it's unfortunate it took a
decade.

I would love for Rust to be proactive in looking at userland functionality, and
pulling in functionality to improve our workflows. There are many possible
angles here, but I think a good start is to look at popular stdlib extension
crates and craft a path forward from there. Low hanging fruit first.

But it's not only on the Rust teams to improve our workflows. I think it's up to
all of us to engage. Something I've found to be of a lot of value recently is
the idea that [we should reject haunted
forests](https://john-millikin.com/sre-school/no-haunted-forests).

If a piece of code is too difficult to understand, it's up to us to simplify it.
If people care more about creating a brand than advancing the state of Rust, we
should reject them. There's lots of nuance here for sure. But as a guiding theme
I'd like us to actively condone centralization of power, by rejecting the
devices that create it. No hero culture. No lone experts. No haunted forests.

The reason why I bring this is up is because if we want to come up
with better solutions, we need to experiment more. Try things out. Share our
findings. And not be daunted by what already exists! Together we can advance the
state of Rust, and improve our workflows! Or well,
[we](https://github.com/rust-clique/man)
[can](https://github.com/rust-clique/human-panic)
[try](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/crossgen).

### Debugging
This is the final point I'll be making. I'd love there to be a good debugging
story in Rust. Whether it's [adding a `--rr`
flag](http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2018/09/21/office-hours-0-debugging-with-gdb/)
to `cargo test`,
[adding breakpoints](https://crates.io/crates/breakpoint) to stdlib, introducing
a [static probing](https://cuviper.github.io/rust-libprobe/doc/probe/), or ensuring
our mutexes are compatible with [existing debugging
tools](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E36784_01/html/E36871/plockstat-1m.html). We
all benefit from having a comprehensive debug story.

I'd love for Rust to be just as pleasant to debug as it is to author.

## Conclusion
And that's it! I hope you got a good idea of what I think we should focus on for
the next while. Personally I'll be spending a bunch of time next year working on
HTTP Networking & WASM things because I think those are important too.

But this post was meant to paint the broad strokes, and shine light on areas
that need work started so I don't go in too much detail on either. Perhaps I'll
draft another post to cover both, either. Something like that.

Thanks heaps for reading. Peace!
