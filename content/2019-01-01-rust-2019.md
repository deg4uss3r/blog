Hi everyone. Thanks for arriving on my blog! This is a post about Rust 2019,
covering the last year, and looking forward to the next 3. With a special focus
on the next 12 months. I hope it comes in useful!

## Looking back

Unlike some folks I'm no Rust veteran. I started casually tinkering with Rust
back in 2016, but only became serious about it in 2018.

2018 was the first time I had a chance to use [Rust
professionally](https://github.com/datrs), joined [a working
group](https://github.com/rust-clique), and then joined [another working
group](https://github.com/rust-net-web). And I guess I'm becoming involved with
[another working group](https://github.com/rustwasm/) now too. Whoops.

It's hard to reflect on 2018 by itself. I can't comment on how different 2018
was as opposed to, say, 2017. But I feel like things have continuously changed &
improved, and am super excited about it!

### Nice things
It's hard to pick a favorite moment in 2018. I think the project has progressed
a lot, and it's been wonderful to see. I'm particularly impressed by how
designs, ideas, and reflections have been shared in the open

### Not so nice things
Earlier this year someone in the Rust community got doxxed. It required several
people to step in, but it got dark. Not good.

At the end of the year [the new website](https://rust-lang.org) was met with
mixed reactions. Some positive. Some negative. And some unprofessional. I was
involved for part of the project, and drawing the ire of a mob isn't fun. Though
luckily I was shielded from the worst of it - yay holiday. But still boo
overall.

Also the Net WG had a bit of trouble getting off the ground this year. It
[required a
reboot](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/wg-net/blob/master/meetings/2018-08-03.md),
in August. And even though good work has been done, we didn't operate nearly as
smoothly or consistently as the Embedded or WASM WGs have.

## Looking ahead

### People
I could say a lot, but others have said it better. In particular I implore you
to read [Boats](https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/rust-2019/) and
[Gattozzi](https://mgattozzi.com/rust-in-2019-the-next-year-and-edition/). I
endorse everything they've said, and think the points they raise should be
prioritized before anything else.

Rust has been among the fastest growing programming languages
([chart](https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2018/11/growth_share_matrix-3.png),
[article](https://whoisnnamdi.com/the-growth-share-matrix-of-software-development/)),
and it is crucial for us to think about how we're going to deal with the next 3
years of (exponential) growth. Because our existing systems are going to hit
limits eventually, and [it's best to be in control when they
do](https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/263429.html).

Also I often think about [this
quote](https://twitter.com/aurynn/status/1062848550197911553) by Aurynn:

> Diversity is an emergent effect of inclusive behaviour.

I think it's important for us to reflect on the way we communicate. When is the
last time you've publicly admitted you made a mistake? If someone disengaged
from a conversation, why did disengage? If there's people that used to be
around, why aren't they around anymore? Have we actively reached out to people,
or did we just expect them to join in?

It's not only crucial for us to reflect on the grand scheme of things, but also
on the way *we* communicate. Talk to others. Ask for feedback. Dare to be
vulnerable. Be better.

### Compiler
I'd love to talk about the compiler, but in reality I don't know much about it.
I've started work on implementing [a small
feature](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/55715), but I ran out of time
before I could complete it. This was not a people problem, but a hardware
problem. The feedback cycle between making a change and seeing the results was
about 1 hour. And it's not just code, it applies to docs too.

I think it'd be amazing if the project could find a way to make compiler hacking
more accessible. I think the structure used in
[chalk](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/chalk) and
[datafrog](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/datafrog) are excellent examples
of what could be done to improve.

There's lots of cool things happening in compiler land, and I think it's a shame
if those are only be accessible to people who have the financial means to buy
fast computers (like me).

### Debugging
