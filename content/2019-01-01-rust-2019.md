Hi everyone. Thanks for arriving on my blog! This is a post about Rust 2019,
covering the last year, and looking forward to the next 3. I hope it comes in
useful!

## Looking back

Unlike some folks I'm no Rust veteran. I started casually tinkering with Rust
back in 2016, but only became serious about it in 2018.

2018 was the first time I had a chance to use [Rust
professionally](https://github.com/datrs), joined [a working
group](https://github.com/rust-clique), and then joined [another working
group](https://github.com/rust-net-web). And I guess I'm becoming involved with
[another working group](https://github.com/rustwasm/) now too. Whoops.

It's hard to reflect on 2018 by itself. I can't comment on how different 2018
was as opposed to, say, 2017. But I feel like things have continuously changed &
improved, and am super excited about it!

### Nice things
It's hard to pick a favorite moment in 2018. I think the project has progressed
a lot, and it's been wonderful to see. I'm particularly impressed by how
designs, ideas, and reflections have been shared in the open

### Not so nice things
Earlier this year someone in the Rust community got doxxed. It required several
people to step in, but it got dark. Not good.

At the end of the year [the new website](https://rust-lang.org) was met with
mixed reactions. Some positive. Some negative. And some unprofessional. I was
involved for part of the project, and drawing the ire of a mob isn't fun. Though
luckily I was shielded from the worst of it. Yay holiday. But still boo
overall.

Also the Net WG had a bit of trouble getting off the ground this year. It
[required a
reboot](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/wg-net/blob/master/meetings/2018-08-03.md),
in August. And even though good work has been done, we didn't operate nearly as
smoothly or consistently as the Embedded or WASM WGs have.

## Looking ahead

### People
I could say a lot, but others have said it better. In particular I implore you
to read [Boats](https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/rust-2019/) and
[Gattozzi](https://mgattozzi.com/rust-in-2019-the-next-year-and-edition/). I
endorse everything they've said, and think the points they raise should be
prioritized above anything else.

Rust has been among the fastest growing programming languages
([chart](https://whoisnnamdi.com/content/images/2018/11/growth_share_matrix-3.png),
[article](https://whoisnnamdi.com/the-growth-share-matrix-of-software-development/)),
and it is crucial for us to think about how we're going to deal with the next 3
years of (exponential) growth. Because our existing systems are going to hit
limits eventually, and [it's best to be in control when they
do](https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/263429.html).

Also I often think about [this
quote](https://twitter.com/aurynn/status/1062848550197911553) by Aurynn:

> Diversity is an emergent effect of inclusive behaviour.

I think it's important for us to reflect on the way we communicate. When is the
last time you've publicly admitted you made a mistake? If someone disengaged
from a conversation, why did disengage? If there's people that used to be
around, why aren't they around anymore? Have we actively reached out to people,
or did we just expect them to join in?

It's not only crucial for us to reflect on the grand scheme of things, but also
on the way *we* communicate. Talk to others. Ask for feedback. Dare to be
vulnerable. Try to be a better person, #rust-2019.

### Compiler
I'd love to talk about the compiler, but in reality I don't know much about it.
I've started work on implementing [a small
feature](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/55715), but I ran out of time
before I could complete it. This was not a people problem, but a hardware
problem. The feedback cycle between making a change and seeing the results was
about 1 hour. And it's not just code, it applies to docs too.

I think it'd be amazing if the project could find a way to make compiler hacking
more accessible. I think the structure used in
[chalk](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/chalk) and
[datafrog](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/datafrog) are excellent examples
of what could be done to improve.

There's lots of cool things happening in compiler land, and I think it's a shame
if those are only be accessible to people who have the financial means to buy
fast computers (like me).

### Language
Similar to the compiler, I don't know a lot about language design. I'm very
empathetic to people that have been involved with the language though. And a
sound I'm increasingly hearing is: ["No new
features"](https://words.steveklabnik.com/thoughts-on-rust-in-2019). It think it
makes a lot of sense to work through the current backlog of features before
accepting any more.

I don't think anybody knows what Rust will look like once we have [const
generics](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2000), [generalized type
ascription](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2522) and [generic associated
types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1598) in the language. Just to
name a few.

[Language design is fractal](https://youtu.be/0sIgVnRAcn0). Every change unlocks
the opportunity for more changes. I think it's healthy for the project to slow
down for a bit on designing more features, and allowing the rest of us to catch
up. Also giving more people the chance to catch up on the language's design, and
provide feedback on what is important to prioritize.

### Platforms
The [Rust WASM toolchain](https://github.com/rustwasm/) is fantastic! In [his
post](http://fitzgeraldnick.com/2018/12/11/rust-2019-think-bigger.html), Fitzgen
talks about possibly even merging the WASM toolchain into Cargo. I think that's
something to be super excited about!

I'd love see WASM's approach adopted for more targets. Can we make first-class
toolchains for iOS, Android,
[BPF](https://opensource.com/article/17/9/intro-ebpf)? Can we build more
[high-quality cross-platform
abstractions](https://docs.rs/gfx-hal/0.1.0/gfx_hal/)? I'd love to see us try!

### Workflow
Node.js's [mkdirp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mkdirp) package has 5 million
weekly downloads. By contrast Rust's most popular package,
[libc](https://crates.io/crates/libc), has 11 million downloads total. I think
it's uncontroversial to say that apparently people want to create directories
recursively reasonably often.

This was reason enough for Node.js to add a `recursive` flag to
[`fs.mkdir()`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_mkdir_path_options_callback)
this year. I'm glad they did. But it's unfortunate it took a decade.

I would love for Rust to learn from this process, be proactive in looking at
userland functionality, and continuously improve our workflows.

But it's not only on Rust to improve our workflows. We, as a community, should
engage with this too. Perhaps something I've found to be of most value recently
is the idea that [we should reject haunted
forests](https://john-millikin.com/sre-school/no-haunted-forests).

If a piece of code is too difficult to understand, it's up to us to simplify it.
If people in are more about branding their projects than they care about the
shared progress, we should reject them. This is not a call to be mean to people.
But it is a call to be critical of the tools we work with, and reject
opaqueness.
