Two days ago I wrote about [what I plan to work on this
year](https://blog.yoshuawuyts.com/plans-for-2019/).
This is my post about what I'd like to see happen with [WebAssembly and Rust in
2019](https://rustwasm.github.io/2018/12/06/reflecting-on-rust-and-wasm-in-2018.html#rustwasm2019).

## Status quo
2018 has been a really cool year for WASM and Rust. Back in February the
WASM toolchain became usable. Around the same time both
[wasm-bindgen](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen) and
[wasm-pack](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack) were kicked off (I remember
the dates because of [this gem](https://github.com/browserify/rustify)).

I think it's interesting to point this out, because it means that at the time of
writing Rust's defacto WASM toolchain is about 9 months old. That's not a long
time for a project that is now considered standard. It's super impressive how
much the WASM WG has accomplished last year!

Let's take a look at what might be possible to accomplish this year.

## fn main
The narrative of the WASM WG's tooling in 2018 has mostly revolved around
allowing people building browser applications to gradually introduce Rust into
their workflows. This has been great for people looking to improve parts of
their existing JavaScript codebase.

I'd like Rust's WASM story to focus on building an integrated experience this
year. Even though WASM is not intended to replace JavaScript, I think we can
learn a lot by pushing WASM as far as we can by itself. I think this should give
us insights in what is missing, and what needs improving, leading us to create a
better Rust WASM experience for *every* workflow.

I think a good goal is to aim to add first-class support for standalone WASM
binaries. Standalone meaning: the Rust code drives the application logic, rather
than having JavaScript call into Rust library functions.

For example
[`[wasm_bindgen(start)]`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/pull/1057)
can be used as an application entry point, and the resulting binaries can be
served with a static web server. But neither of them feel as nice as Rust's own
`fn main` and `cargo run`.

## Build an ecosystem
Speaking of ecosystems, we should probably build one! There's a few points I
think are important:

1. __Don't create branded silos.__ Branding might perhaps be useful to achieve
   fame. But if we truly want Rust's WASM story to succeed we should
   think of ways to collaborate instead of carving out territory.
2. __Centralize discovery.__ We're trying to build an ecosystem from scratch.
   Having a place where module authors can share their results will likely allow
   us to coordinate without much overhead. Something that for example might work
   is for the WASM WG to create an
   [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/awesome.md)
   list under the GitHub org, and liberally accepting contributions.
3. __Encourage experimentation.__ I think it's way too early in Rust's lifecycle
   to know what the right way is to do things. Even more so for Rust WASM. I
   think we should encourage experimentation and sharing results early. The
   lower we can make the boundary to experiment, the likelier it is that people
   will get involved, and in turn the likelier the ecosystem will grow in both
   size and quality.

## Keep polishing
This is the "miscellaneous" part of my post. There's some things I've noticed
that are missing, or I wish we had in no particular order:
- `wasm-bindgen` doesn't generate source maps yet. Having them would be
  excellent for debugging.
- The story around async and WASM seems only partly executed so far. Rust
  Futures can be converted to JS Promises and hooked into the JS event loop, but
  running your own multi-threaded loop seems to involve a lot of manual work
  still.
- Rust WASM artifacts are single binaries which are hard to cache and
  incrementally load. There's probably exploration possible around code
  splitting and dynamically loading.
- Setting up a WASM project requires [quite some
  boilerplate](https://github.com/rustwasm/rust-webpack-template/blob/7ff65a1a463a770a5ed3c370c114a59a7629cb86/crate/src/lib.rs#L8-L28).
  It'd be nice if we could find ways to reduce this.
- Passing errors to and from JS [isn't as smooth as it could
  be](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/issues/1017).

## Wrapping up
And that's more or less what I'd like to see from Rust WASM this year. I feel
Rust's WASM story is very much on the right patch already, and I hope this will
only keep improving in 2019.

I hope this has been useful. Thanks for reading!
