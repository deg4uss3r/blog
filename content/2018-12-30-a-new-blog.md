# A new blog

Hey everyone! Welcome to my new blog. Stretch your legs. Make yourself at home.

## Why?
I used to be quite active on [Medium.com](https://medium.com/@yoshuawuyts), but
I don't think the site has been changing for the better, and want to try
something new. Something that's my own. Something where I have the creative
freedom to structure it however I like.

So this is it.

## Is this a dat:// site?

It's not. At least: not yet. Perhaps we'll get there eventually, but for now I'm
happy to build a static site, and distribute it from my own server. I've always
wanted to be better at managing servers, and this is a fun addition to my
growing collection of things running on a single 5/euro month instance. Keeping
things static means performance is reliable, and reliability is nice for hobby
projects.

A long story short: perhaps I'll make the jump to dat:// eventually. But not
right now.

## Source

You can find the source on
[github.com/yoshuawuyts/blog](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/blog), and the
server configuration on
[github.com/yoshuawuyts/server](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/server). The
theme is [Zola After Dark](https://github.com/getzola/after-dark), but I expect
it won't be long before I start tinkering with it.

## Wrapping Up
Thanks for reading! I hope you visit again soon!
