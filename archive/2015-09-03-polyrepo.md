# polyrepo

Monorepo's are a bad idea. They block reusability and collaboration with
everything outside of it and encourage monolithic dependencies.

I can think of two cases where a monorepo makes sense:
1. you don't care about external code
2. you're an enterprise and have enough minions to not have to care about
   external code. (which is in essence the same as 1)

Monorepos are a relic of the past. The future isn't monolithic; it's modular
and distributed.

## The opposite of mono is poly.
Instead of relying on a singular code base that contains all the code we should
have multiple code bases and the tools to manage them well. This allows us to
emulate a monorepo, except it is kept distributed. Managing a large amount of
code is never easy, but having the right tools allows us to do a better job.

## Tools, tools, tools
Maintaining a distributed codebase requires the same actions as a monolithic
codebase. Essentially they could be treated the same. Here are some basic
actions that would need to be performed:

- pull the distributed codebase
- install all dependencies
- run all tests
- mark a specific repo as deprecated
- check which dependencies are out of date
- update all dependencies
- commit and publish changes
- see which parts of the codebase are stale

## What more?
Nothing more. But to close it off, here's a fun fact: Did you know that most of
git is written in shell? Tools don't have to be complicated to be useful.
