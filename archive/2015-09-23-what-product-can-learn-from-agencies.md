# what product teams can learn from agencies

- fast iteration
- build up core components
- extract and publish
- experiment and try out
- keep code clean
- repeat

- teams are more important than the product, workflow is what makes a team.
- build things, integrate later -> more visible results sooner which drive
  iteration.
