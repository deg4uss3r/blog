These are notes on the next version of [choo](https://choo.io/), a sturdy
frontend framework. It's by no means close to done, but I feel the general
direction is solid and I want to share some of the process while it's still
fresh.

---
## So why change things?
[I recently got a job üéâüéâüéâüéâ.](http://datproject.org/) This means not only working
with some of the kindest humans I know - it's also meant that I got to test a
lot of my work in the wild. I've had a good chance to see where
people struggle learning, which abstractions started to break down and how we
could improve all that.

Another thing that comes into play is that the current version of choo is
hilariously unsuited for any performance sensitive-realtime application. Much
like other frontend framework, it creates a lot of garbage on every update -
which means when the time comes to collect the garbage, the application takes a
rather long break. In most programs you won't notice this, but when
live-editing multiple audio streams this delay can be catastrophic.

## So what's changing?
### Mutable state
First off state is going to become mutable. At the moment state is immutable at
any given time. But given that views are snapshots of the state anyway, it
makes no sense to also make the state immutable - it creates unnecessary work
for the garbage collector so we're tossing it out.

### New model API
By making state mutable, we can change the model API. Models choo's abstraction
for managing data. In the current version there's a lot of words to learn and
some of the APIs are rather quirky. We're going to remove all the method names,
and just have a callback that receives the state.

```js
var app = choo()
app.model(function (state, bus) {
  console.log('state is', state)
})
```

### Reactive programming
It turns out flux-like architectures are rather hard to deal with in real-world
scenarios. Using event emitters is simpler to reason about, and more
expressive. We'll be using Node's `require('events')` API, so if you're
familiar with how Node works this should be very intuitive. It also means less
words to learn.

```js
var app = choo()
app.model(function (state, bus) {
  bus.on('foo', function () {
    console.log('foo called')
  })
  bus.emit('foo')
})
```

### A shiny diffing algorithm
We'll probably put [nanomorph](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/nanomorph) in
there instead of the current diffing engine. It might be a little buggy, but
the perf increase / API stability should be worth it.

### Transparent DOM updates
Rather than having odd message orders, re-rendering the DOM will be done by
calling `emit('render')`.

### Lazy loading applications
Traditionally it wasn't possible to declare models after the application had
started. This will now be possible, which enables code splitting. This was
probably one of the most sought-after features that we couldn't deliver on,
until now.

### Components
Last, but not least we'll be adding components.
[nanocomponent](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/nanocomponent/) was written a
little while back, and it's pretty neat. It allows creating
[framework-agnostic](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/nanocomponent-adapters/)
elements that have a whole range of lifecycle events and has built-in caching
of elements. It even allows using fancy new APIs like
`window.requestIdleCallback` and `window.InterSectionObserver`. Very neat-o.

## What are we losing?
### ~25% size
Some quick testing indicates that choo will now be ~4kb. Not that it matters at
that point, but yeah we're shedding a few bytes.

### Plugins
Choo currently has a rather rich plugin system. By switching to event emitters
plugins won't be needed anymore, as it's much easier to keep track of what's
going on. By using the `.on('*')` event you can even listen to all events,
which is useful for things like logging.

### Namespaces
Namespaces are being moved out of choo, and into userland. This means that
namespacing events becomes convention-based and can be used where needed. Given
that the current namespacing abstraction is shaky at best, this change will
probably feel like a big relief.

## So what's next?
It's hard to promise we'll never break things, but I think choo should be in an
OK place at v5. There's little left to remove in both API and code.

It'd be cool if we could go into something close to maintenance mode, kind of
like how `browserify` and `level` are in maintenance mode. One can dream
though; but yeah I feel we're getting one step closer.

And that's it - I hope this somewhat explained what's coming next for choo. If
you'd like to run some of this code, [there's now a repo up with an executable
API sketch](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/playground-nanoframework).

If you liked these words, I also write words over [on
