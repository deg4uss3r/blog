# Using the filesystem in Node.js

Node prides itself for having a minimal core. Where some languages ship
bindings for the full POSIX API, Node tries to ship the minimum amount of
bindings required to provide full functionality and exposes it through a
`sync`, `async` and `stream` api.

This approach means that there are some convenience functions that ship in the
OS that must be recreated in Node. This is a pragmatic guide to staple Node
filesystem packages.

## Referencing files
When interacting with the filesystem it's important to point to the right file.
As npm packages are bundled into other repositories it's important to use
dynamic links, rather than hardcoding relationships. There are two staple
patterns to make sure packages reference the right files:
```js
// use `path.join()` over `+` to keep Windows users happy
const path = require('path')

// find a file relative to the call site, useful for CLI applications
// and reading files passed in by the user
path.join(process.cwd(), 'my-dynamic-file')

// find a file relative to the file, useful for referencing files that are
// distributed with the package
path.join(__dirname, 'my-package-file')
```

## Reading files
In Node the easiest way of asynchronously reading files is to use streams!
Here's an example:
```js
const path = require('path')
const fs = require('fs')

// read a file and pipe it to the console
fs.createReadStream(path.join(__dirname, 'my-file'))
  .pipe(process.stdout)
```

## Creating files
Creating files isn't that much harder, here's a Node implementation of the
shell `cat` command:
```js
const path = require('path')
const fs = require('fs')

// cat ./my-file > ./my-other-file
fs.createReadStream(path.join(__dirname, 'my-file'))
  .pipe(fs.createWriteStream(path.join(__dirname, './my-other-file')))
```

## Removing files
Removing files and directories is usually done with the shell `rm -rf` command.
In Node this would be achieved using the
[`rimraf`](https://github.com/isaacs/rimraf) package:
```js
const rimraf = require('rimraf')
const path = require('path')

rimraf(path.join(__dirname, './my-directory'), err => {
  if (err) throw err
})
```

## Creating directories
Creating directories is very similar to removing files using the
[`mkdirp`](https://github.com/substack/node-mkdirp) package:
```js
const mkdirp = require('mkdirp')
const path = require('path')

mkdirp(path.join(__dirname, 'foo/bar'), err => {
  if (err) throw err
})
```

## Finding files
Find files in the current directory with
[readdirp](https://github.com/thlorenz/readdirp):

```js
const readdirp = require('readdirp')
const json = require('JSONStream')
const path = require('path')

// recursively print out all files in all subdirectories
// to the command line. The object stream must be
// stringified before being passed to `stdout`.
readdirp({ root: path.join(__dirname) })
  .pipe(json.stringify())
  .pipe(process.stdout)
```

Find a file in the current directory's parent directories with
[findup](https://github.com/Filirom1/findup):

```js
const findup = require('findup')
const path = require('path')

// recurse up all files relative to __dirname and find
// all `package.json` files.
findup(path.join(__dirname), 'package.json', (err, res) => {
  if (err) throw err
  console.log('dir is: ' + res)
})
```

## Note on robustness
Though I've never used it, I've heard good things about
[`graceful-fs`](https://github.com/isaacs/node-graceful-fs). It has retries,
queues and other goodies built in. Give it a shot if you run into filesystem
issues.

## Note on pipes
When piping lots of streams together it's important to handle `error` events.
Rather than doing `.on('error', cb)` on each individual stream it's recommended
to use [`pump`](https://github.com/mafintosh/pump) to handle errors and
properly close streams.
```js
const pump = require('pump')
const fs = require('fs')

// oh no, no errors are handled!
fs.createReadStream('./in.file').pipe(fs.createWriteStream('./out.file'))

// that's better, we're handing errors now
const rs = fs.createReadStream('./in.file')
const ws = fs.createWriteStream('./out.file')
pump(rs, ws, err => {
  if (err) throw err
})
```
