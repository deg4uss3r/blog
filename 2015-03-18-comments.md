# comments

I'm an Open Source guy; I like using other people's code, and from time to time
reading through it to understand how it was built. Whenever code is commented I
feel more relaxed reading through it; I get free insight into what the author
was thinking while writing it.

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, that means that there are no easy
constructs in the language to specify which types and properties we're
accepting. To partially address this, [docBlock](http://yui.github.io/yuidoc/)
comments were invented. They provide a structured way of showing all sorts of
meta data about your function. Here's an example:

```js
/**
 * Creates a function that sums two numbers.
 * @param {Number} arg1
 * @return {Function}
 */
function foobar (arg1) {
  /**
   * The inner function of foobar.
   * @param {Number} arg2
   * @return {Number}
   */
  return function bin (arg2) {
    return arg1 + arg2
  }
}
```

That's 10 lines of comments for 4 lines of code, a ratio of 2.5:1. That's quite
a few lines for something that's a brief description + documentation of the
types. 

I was slightly annoyed by this, and figured it could be improved:

```js
// Creates a function that sums two numbers.
// foobar(Number:arg1) -> bin(Number:arg2) -> Number
function foobar (arg1) {
  return function bin (arg2) {
    return arg1 + arg2
  }
}
```

That's 2 lines of comments for 4 lines of code, which to me feels much better.
By adopting a [haskell](https://www.haskell.org/tutorial/goodies.html)ish
notation we're able to write things down more concisely and keep the code as
focused as possible. 

This is not the answer to JS's lack of a proper type system, but I feel it does 
a better job than docBlock and will help my future self a great deal in making 
sense of my old code.
