# projects without a po

Doing projects is hard. At agencies projects are the only thing you do, trying
to meet the clients requirements while keeping within the boundaries of the
budget. To do this efficiently methods under the _agile_ umbrella have been
developed. Their main goal: reduce time wasted and produce results asap.

With agile there are well defined roles. Generally speaking there will always
be three roles in a project. A product owner (PO) who lays out the
requirements. A project manager (PM) who scopes the requirements into
actionables (and keeps time / budget in check). And the team who actually get
to design & build the thing.

With smaller teams, perhaps even just a single person, it's easy to think that
this kind of hierarchy is too much. That's not true. As long as someone else is
making the requirements, you've already got a PO / PM structure in place.
However, if the PO is also the PM you're heading for trouble. It's important
that the person making the demands is not also the person that makes the time
estimates.

Also of importance is to scope down the requirements. If you're aiming to
release a feature to the public, don't mark the first release as "all the
features should be done", but rather the minimum you can get away with. And
then a bit less than that.

Something I'm curious about is how to plan in time for refactoring and removing
technical debt. If there's never time to do this projects collapse under their
own weight and work can become unpleasurable. If anyone has ideas about this
I'd be keen to hear.
