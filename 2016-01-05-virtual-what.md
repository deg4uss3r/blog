# virtual-what am I even looking at
Happy 2016! Let's create a website using the latest best practices:

1. create a directory
2. initialize git
2. set up the latest
   [`{webpack,react,redux,babel,css-modules,postcss,rucksack,react-router}`][0]
   boilerplate
3. write some code
4. deploy
5. success!

If you're anything like most people, you have no idea what's going on in the
second step. Some names might seem familiar, but some are new since you last
checked 4 weeks ago. You might feel silly for not knowing that, and keep quiet.
Maybe you feel things are moving too fast, and ashamed you've not been keeping
up.

It's not on you though; all these tools that might seem simple by themselves
turn into a giant ball of silly when chucked together. It's not pretty if
you're trying to do the right thing.

In this article I'll explain the ideas driving the current orientation of
tooling, and how to use minimal abstractions to achieve those ideas. But first
I want you to remember the following:

> Your choice of tools is irrelevant for your project.

If you're building a new product, don't worry about what boilerplate you're
using; it'll only be used once. Don't worry about what build system you're
going for, it's only a stepping stone for results. If you're building a
project, focus on being able to iterate fast and make a best effort to decouple
things. Your choice of tools today will not dictate the speed of iteration, nor
the quality of your product. Architecture, scope and maintenance are what you
should be worrying about.

There's nothing wrong

Step 2 might seem like a bit much, but it's totally justified!
If you're like most people, you'll have no idea what's going on in the second
step.

Sure, you've heard `react` is good because Facebook built it and it
introduces something called `virtual-dom` which is supposed to be good. And
sure, ES6 is the next version of JavaScript so we need babel. And `react`
