# Onnables

Lately I've been working a lot with ES6 promises. Whereas at first they seemed
pretty unintuitive, I'm starting to see how they can be useful. In order to be
used inside of a Promise chain, all a value has to do is expose a `.then()`
function. If a value doesn't have a `.then()` present, ES6 promises cast them
to a Promise anyway, but that's beside the point here. 

What is interesting is the fact that by having a common interface, any function 
can pretend to be a Promise and play ball with them.

Node streams work in the same way by exposing a `.pipe()` function. Arrays have 
`.map()` (`mappables`) and generators have the `.next()` function that calls
the next `yield`.

There's one that I've been missing in this list, and that is the common
interface of events. In Node events always expose a `.on()` and `.then()`
function. Just like `.then()`, these `.on()` calls can be infinitely chained. I
shall name them (_a brief moment of silence for horrible naming_) `onnables`.

Events are neat, objects shouldn't be afraid to have more listeners as they are
super super cheap (compared to observers, which are expensive by design, to the
dismay of [many](https://angularjs.org/)). By recognizing this common
interface, it might be easier to create modules that can consume these
`onnables` and do interesting things with them, no matter what they actually
do. A bit like with Promises and their `thennables`.

And that concludes my Tuesday-evening brainfart, time for me to slowly slither
back to preparing a presentation.
